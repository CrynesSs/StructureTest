         * prevent any sort of crash or issue with other mod's custom ChunkGenerators. If they use
         * FlatGenerationSettings.STRUCTURE_FEATURES in it and you don't add your structure to it, the game
         * could crash later when you attempt to add the StructureSeparationSettings to the dimension.
         *
         * (It would also crash with superflat worldtype if you omit the below line
         * and attempt to add the structure's StructureSeparationSettings to the world)
         *
         * Note: If you want your structure to spawn in superflat, remove the FlatChunkGenerator check
         * in StructureTutorialMain.addDimensionalSpacing and then create a superflat world, exit it,
         * and re-enter it and your structures will be spawning. I could not figure out why it needs
         * the restart but honestly, superflat is really buggy and shouldn't be your main focus in my opinion.
         *
         * Requires AccessTransformer ( see resources/META-INF/accesstransformer.cfg )
